## My Projects
View different applications and websites I've made here so far. These are in a functional state, but I may make updates to them as necessary.

### [Calpardy!](https://calvinchristensen96.github.io/calpardy/index.html)  
- A trivia game you can play by yourself or together with friends locally. All questions and answers are from the game show Jeopardy, and are used from the [jService](https://jservice.io/) api. A quick play mode is playable now and I plan to continue adding other game modes. 

### [Chordy](https://calvinchristensen96.github.io/chordy/index2.html)  
- An online chord dictionary. This web application helps the user identify musical chords.

### [Pokémon Go: Combat Power Maximizer](https://calvinchristensen96.github.io/pkmngo/index.html)  
- Web application to be used alongside the mobile video-game Pokémon Go, by Niantic. This application provides detailed stats to help the user identify which ivs a selected Pokemon needs to have in order to maximize it's CP.

### [Tetris Clone](https://calvinchristensen96.github.io/tetris-clone/index.html)  
- A clone of the puzzle game **Tetris**, written in JavaScript.
